## SetUp Instructions
You must have Android Studio to use an Android Emulator, or connect your Android Device.
To set up, clone this directory to your desktop. Navigate inside directory using terminal, and run "yarn android". 
Because installing extra dependencies was not allowed, this app does not have navigation.
The CreateLaunch screen is partially built out. To view, comment out < LaunchFeed/ > in App.js and comment in < CreateLaunch/ >.

## Building the Screens and Components
 
This app has 3 screens and consumes an open API provided by SpaceX. The mock ups are found here:

Assignment: Spend 1 - 2 hours building out as much of the app as possible. For the purposes of this interview, it makes the most sense to focus on the Launch List Screen. While there are multiple screens and navigation in the design, for the purposes of this project donâ€™t worry about navigation. You can stub out methods for navigation and only render 1 screen at a time. You should be able to complete the project without installing additional dependencies.
